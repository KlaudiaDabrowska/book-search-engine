# Book search engine

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A web application for finding books from the public Google API (https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#WorkingVolumes). Books can be searched by title, author or ISBN. After the search, a list of results appears. One result contains the title, author, book cover, and short description. The application includes an infinite scroll.
